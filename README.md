# Connect-4-AI-8x8-Hardcoded-Negamax
<br>- Basically predicts all the possible moves by itself and the opponent then tries to choose the best move to go.
<br>- Default depth = 6, more than 6 would take minutes to run.
<br>- The board size (8x8) was extremely hardcoded, and I was too lazy to make it constant again. If u want to change the board size u would need to change every digit in the code.
